# Events SPA challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##Why there's so few commits?
Because it was a coding challenge for a company interview and the content of the challenge like API is private.
So I had to remove git history and change all data provided by the company for the challenge.

## Install dependencies
Run `yarn` to install all necessary dependencies

## Development server
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Mocked API
Run `npm run server` for a mocked API that will serve `events` and `cities`
